# Amazon Bestseller Book Webscraper
This project is a web scraper that navigates through Amazon to collect data on the most popular books listed on the platform. 
It gathers crucial details including the book's title, author, ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number), and category.
The data from the titles is then sent to the OpenAI API which performs a double summarization to condense the title down to a maximum of 6 words. 
All the collected and processed data are neatly saved into an Excel sheet for easy analysis and reference.
